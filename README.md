Heyo!

So this is the solution by hardcoding the categories and sails.

I've only done the sails as it's quite tedious and takes a lot of time.

A great programmer would do this programmatically or through a CMS but hey - this works and would actually work well for the client as there's probably only 14 sails or something anyway. IT WOULD NEVER WORK FOR NIKE - they have thousands of shoes...

I didn't complete the freestyle category in order for you to try it out - all the images are in place. Give it a try and see how freestyle is made for example.

Cheers & good night!
